          This article assumes others (or more accurately their LLM interpreters
          and agents) no longer want to visit our sites and apps.

          We begin by imagining that LLMs are gatekeepers to the latest
          iteration of Internet portals (after AOL, Flash, etc). Instead of
          visiting sites and downloading apps, we (users, readers, people)
          funnel everything through Claude or ChatGPT or some other intermediary
          that assembles a multitude of LLMs in order to trawl the Internet for
          data which they synthesise and repackage as they see fit. We pay for
          this and/or the advertising that accompanies it.

          <p>We can say a few things about web development and LLMs.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The cost of web app and page development is high</li>
            <li>Interfaces must adapt to a variety of devices and visitors</li>
            <li>LLMs are widely used by web development teams</li>
            <li>
              LLMs are perceived of as assisting people, but may replace them
            </li>
            <li>LLMs are used to increase productivity and to educate</li>
            <li>
              Companies like OpenAI want to mediate (control) our every
              interaction
            </li>
            <li>
              Things will continue in a similar vein until the means of
              production excludes all but a handful of humans
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Pro di immortales!</h3>
          <p>What happens next?</p>
          <p>
            Jakob Nielsen suggested that generative AI could lead to
            <a href="https://www.uxtigers.com/post/accessibility-generative-ui"
              >Individualized UI</a
            >.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is possible that web development teams will use LLMs (generative
            AI) to create multiple custom UIs (though the idea has not gone down
            well).
          </p>
          <p>
            It's also possible that external LLMs will help people create
            interfaces specific to their needs thereby bypassing our interfaces,
            and us.
          </p>

            In this imagined future, for example, online newspapers cease to
            exist. Their content is syndicated by third parties who bundle it
            with other content, wrap the aggregate with metadata (contracts,
            tariffs, advertising) which (a string of) LLMs consume in order to
            render a simulacrum of the original content in the form we (the
            reader) demand.
          </p>
          <p>
            A reader's digest might appeal to the reader. They get what the
            want, when they want it, in the format they want.
          </p>
          <p>Things are never that simple. There's always a cost.</p>

              <li>
                Advertising. Either required by the owner or writer of the
                article, or by a syndicate or by the platform or LLM that
                mediates the process.
              </li>
              <li>
                Loss of oversight. Provence is buried or obscured, bylines lost
                or subject to controls and deals.
              </li>
              <li>Loss of broader editorial concerns and considerations.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              This is a fragmented world of news. For readers and for writers.
              Imprints will no longer have a masthead around which staff can
              rally. Without colleagues, editors, and a common purpose or remit,
              writers are adrift. Free to say what they want but unchallenged,
              and unsupported.
            </p>
            <p>
              If a newspaper no longer has a site of its own, what of its web
              development team?
            </p>
            <p>
              Web development contract work pays well. It's easier to make a
              living as a freelance programmer than as a freelance writer. But
              if the mainstays of digital life, sites and apps, are no longer
              relevant (wanted or needed), contracted and freelance developers,
              designers, product managers, UX specialists, QAs, etc. will
              confront a changed world where some of what they know is
              redundant.

            <p>
              Tools, processes, and environments are secondary to the know-how
              in communicating via digital interfaces. If control over those
              interfaces is not wrested from them (us), colleagues must work
              together on finding new ways to communicate, demonstrating that
              their (our) experience should not be carelessly discarded.

              <p>
                We foresee upheaval in web development. If we do not imagine new
                ways of doing things, we will have little influence over what
                happens next. If we do, we can invent new roles and participate
                in change.

                insights, etc.) and interpreting and representing it.
