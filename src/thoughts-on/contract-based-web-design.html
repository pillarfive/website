      <div class="subtitle">From Protocols to Natural Language Contracts</div>
      <p>
        Within the next decade, automated AI agents will mediate most web
        browsing. In such a paradigm, the owners of content will have little or
        no control over the user interface and experience. This shift requires
        rethinking how we structure web interactions so consumer-side agents can
        communicate effectively with their content owner-side counterparts. We
        propose moving from rigid protocols to natural language contracts that
        both humans and AI can understand and negotiate.
      </p>

      <h2>Key Concepts</h2>

      <p>
        Natural language contracts between AI agents require three fundamental
        properties:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Observability: Established during handshake between consumer and data
          owner
        </li>
        <li>
          Verifiability: Using blockchain or repositories for verification
        </li>
        <li>
          Privity: Knowledge distribution limited to necessary parties (privacy
          is one component of maintaining privity)
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Having a publicly available contract creates a focal point - a default
        solution both parties understand without detailed communication. Unlike
        traditional APIs embedded in interfaces, these contracts can be adapted
        through AI negotiation while maintaining security through established
        verification mechanisms.
      </p>

      <h2>The Evolution of Web Contracts</h2>

      <p>
        The web's development shows a clear progression toward more flexible
        interactions. Initially, protocols provided unambiguous but rigid rules
        for machine-to-machine communication. APIs followed, offering more
        flexibility while remaining machine-first. Now, natural language
        contracts represent the next step - agreements that humans can read and
        AI can execute.
      </p>

      <p>
        This evolution trades unambiguity for flexibility, enabling richer
        interactions through controlled ambiguity. AI agents make this trade-off
        valuable by bridging human and machine understanding.
      </p>

      <h2>AI Agents as Contract Mediators</h2>

      <p>
        AI agents serve as ideal mediators because they communicate in natural
        language while understanding machine code. This dual capability enables:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Concatenation of information from different sources</li>
        <li>Interface-agnostic interactions</li>
        <li>
          Reduced interface costs between human/software and software/software
        </li>
        <li>Natural clarification of ambiguities</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        For example, when a bank requests personal information, traditional
        smart contracts must specify exact cryptographic requirements. With AI
        mediation, the contract can remain implementation-agnostic while
        ensuring security through negotiation.
      </p>

      <h2>Verification and Security</h2>

      <p>
        While embracing natural language flexibility, these contracts maintain
        security through:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Blockchain resilience via decentralised networks</li>
        <li>Integrity through open source protocols</li>
        <li>Public transparency</li>
        <li>Consensus-based modification</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        This framework preserves trust while allowing implementation details to
        emerge through AI negotiation.
      </p>

      <h2>Risks and Challenges</h2>

      <p>
        The shift to natural language contracts introduces several
        considerations:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Knowledge loop concerns in AI-mediated content</li>
        <li>Content reliability verification</li>
        <li>Intellectual property protection</li>
        <li>Service provider brand identity preservation</li>
        <li>Cybersecurity safeguards</li>
        <li>Potential increase in contract-related litigation</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Open Questions</h2>

      <p>
        As we move toward AI-mediated web interactions, several questions
        require exploration:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          How do we ensure contract fulfillment while maintaining flexibility?
        </li>
        <li>What mechanisms enable contract discovery between agents?</li>
        <li>How do we handle controversial information and disputes?</li>
        <li>
          How can natural language contracts maintain security without
          specifying implementation details?
        </li>
        <li>
          How can we ensure the segregation of duty between the parties in a
          context where there are only a few major providers of AI agents?
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        The transition from protocols to natural language contracts mediated by
        AI agents offers more flexible, human-readable web services while
        preserving machine executability. This evolution promises to reshape how
        we interact with web services. However, the inherent tension between
        natural language ambiguity and secure machine execution remains a
        fundamental challenge to overcome.
