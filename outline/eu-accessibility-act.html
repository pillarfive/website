Its primary goal is to enhance the accessibility of a wide range of products and services across the European Union. </p> <h2>Scope</h2> <ul> <li> <strong>Applies to</strong>: <div>The public and private sector</div> <div> Any business that wishes to trade in the EU, wherever it is based </div> </li> <li> <strong>Includes</strong>: Websites, mobile apps, and web applications </li> <li> <strong>Covers</strong>: Both consumer-facing (B2C) and business-to-business (B2B) services </li> </ul> <h2>Exemptions</h2> <ul> <li> <strong>Micro-enterprises</strong>: Generally exempt. A micro-enterprise has fewer than 10 employees and turnover below €2 million <div><em>Voluntary adoption is encouraged</em></div> </li> </ul> <h2>Key Requirements</h2> <ul> <li> Adherence to established accessibility standards. Meeting WCAG 2.1 Level AA ensures compliance. <div> <em>Please note WCAG 2.2 is officially a W3C recommendation</em> </div> </li> <li> Improvements may include: <ul> <li>Enhanced compatibility with assistive technologies</li> <li>Improved keyboard navigability</li> <li>Accessible visual content</li> </ul> </li> <li> The four principles of accessibility of websites and mobile applications are: <dl> <dt><strong>Perceivability</strong></dt> <dd> Meaning that information and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive. </dd> <dt><strong>Operability</strong></dt> <dd> Meaning that user interface components and navigation must be operable. </dd> <dt><strong>Understandability</strong></dt> <dd> Meaning that information and the operation of the user interface must be understandable. </dd> <dt><strong>Robustness</strong></dt> <dd> Meaning that content must be robust enough to be interpreted reliably by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies. </dd> </dl> </li> <li> Accessibility should be achieved by the systematic removal and prevention of barriers, preferably through a universal design or <strong>Design for All</strong> (DfA) approach. </li> </ul> <h2>Compliance Considerations</h2> <ul> <li><strong>Deadline</strong>: June 28th 2025</li> <li> <strong>Penalties</strong>: Vary by member state, may include: <ul> <li>Fines</li> <li>Product removal from market</li> <li>Legal action</li> </ul> </li> <li> <strong>Compliance Costs</strong>: May involve: <ul> <li>Redesigning digital products</li> <li>Staff training</li> <li>Ongoing monitoring</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Impact on Different Businesses</h2> <ul> <li> <strong>Simple websites</strong>: May require minimal adjustments </li> <li> <strong>Complex platforms</strong>: Might need substantial revisions, especially those providing: <ul> <li>Essential services</li> <li> Intricate data analysis (e.g. emissions data recording and analysis) </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Conclusion</h2> <p> The EAA represents a significant step towards digital inclusivity in the EU. Businesses must prepare for compliance to avoid penalties and ensure their products and services are accessible to all, including people with disabilities. </p> <h2>References</h2> <dl> <dt> <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/BRIE/2017/603973/EPRS_BRI(2017)603973_EN.pdf">European Accessibility Act</a> </dt> <dd> To ensure the full participation of people with disabilities in society, and to reduce the fragmentation of legislation governing access to products and services, the European Commission has adopted a proposal for a directive – often referred to as the European Accessibility Act. </dd> <dt> <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/new-in-22/">What's New in WCAG 2.2</a> </dt> <dd> WCAG documents explain how to make web content more accessible to people with disabilities. </dd> <dt> <a href="https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/design-for-all">Design for All</a> </dt> <dd> Design for All is a concept that describes a wide range of design approaches, methods, techniques and tools for designers to meet the vast diversity of users’ needs and requirements.
